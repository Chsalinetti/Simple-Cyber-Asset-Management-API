Project Reflection:

    In reflection, this project went smoothly.
    Most of the functionallity was fairly standard,
    so I didn't face a lot of issues. I did learn
    about pagination, a concept I wasn't super
    familiar with previously. Overall this served
    as an enjoyable project, and a good refresher for
    me on some of these skills.
