What would you change given extra time?

    If give the extra time, I would like to add
    functionallity to better validate and normalize
    the data inputted into the database. I would
    also like to add functionallity to add a "batch"
    of assets into the database, which could improve
    usability and performace greatly.

What would you add to the API to make it more secure?

    I would implement some sort of authorization
    and authentication method, especially for
    any endpoints which change or delete asset data.

Would you continue using the same database?

    Depends on the scale of the project, likely
    not if this project needed to be larger.

Could the project be more portable?

    This project could be made more portable 
    by using containerization tools like Docker.
